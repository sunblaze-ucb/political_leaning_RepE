abortion,"In a campaign speech Biden said, ""If I have anything to do with it, I'm going to end up signing a law reinstating Roe v. Wade."" ","Trump's campaign website said, ""He confirmed three strong Constitutionalists to the United States Supreme Court who will ensure the law is upheld equally, fairly and without political prejudice for all of our citizens. President Trump's three appointees delivered the biggest win for life in a generation in overturning Roe v. Wade."" "
the administrative state,,"Trump's campaign website listed the following policies, ""On Day One, re-issue 2020 executive order restoring the president's authority to fire rogue bureaucrats. Overhaul federal departments and agencies, firing all of the corrupt actors in our National Security and Intelligence apparatus. [...] Launch a major crackdown on government leakers who collude with the media to create false narratives, pressing criminal charges when appropriate. Make every Inspector General's Office independent from the departments they oversee, so that they do not become protectors of the deep state."" Trump's campaign website also listed, ""Continue Trump administration effort to move parts of the federal bureaucracy outside of the Washington Swamp, just like President Trump moved the Bureau of Land Management to Colorado. Up to 100,000 government positions could be moved out of Washington. Ban federal bureaucrats from taking jobs at the companies they deal with and regulate, such as Big Pharma."" "
the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation,,"Trump's campaign website said, ""President Trump will 'appoint 100 U.S. Attorneys who will be the 'polar opposite of the Soros District Attorneys' who are destroying the rule of law in America, overhaul the Department of Justice and the, and order sweeping civil rights investigations into Marxist local district attorneys.' President Trump states that 'As we completely overhaul the federal Department of Justice and FBI, we will also launch sweeping civil rights investigations into Marxist local District Attorneys. And that's what we have---they are Marxist in many cases.' Additionally, President Trump 'will have a complete investigation into the use of police state tactics by federal authorities to arrest conservatives and Christians. We will find out who ordered it, and we will hold them totally accountable.'"" "
the coronavirus response,,"Trump's campaign website said, ""To save lives from the China virus, President Trump organized the production of the world's largest supply of ventilators and the development of treatments and vaccines. He will stop all COVID mandates and restore medical freedom."" "
criminal justice,,"Trump's campaign website said, ""There is no higher priority than quickly restoring law and order and public safety in America. President Trump stands with the heroes of law enforcement. Joe Biden and the radical left politicians have defunded, defamed, and dismantled police forces across America. Murders spiked to all-time highs in Democrat-run cities and radical prosecutors and District Attorneys have given free rein to violent criminals who threaten our citizens. The streets of our once-great cities are now controlled by gangs and cartels, and plagued with mentally ill and drug-addicted homeless."" "
policing,,"Trump's campaign website said, ""President Trump will revitalize police departments and reclaim safety, dignity, and peace for law-abiding Americans. He will deliver record funding to hire and retrain police officers, strengthen qualified immunity and other protections for police officers, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, put violent offenders and career criminals behind bars, and surge federal prosecutors and the National Guard into high-crime communities."" "
courts,"In a campaign speech Biden said, ""And because of the great help of Dick Durbin of Illinois, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we've reconfirmed 61 judges --- and more, the first Black appointed judge to the Supreme Court of the United States, a woman.  And combined,  we've appointed more Black women to the appellate courts of the United States than every other president in history combined."" ","Trump's campaign website said, ""President Donald J. Trump appointed nearly 300 federal judges to interpret the Constitution as written and preserve the extraordinary vision of our founding fathers. He confirmed three strong Constitutionalists to the United States Supreme Court who will ensure the law is upheld equally, fairly and without political prejudice for all of our citizens. President Trump's three appointees delivered the biggest win for life in a generation in overturning Roe v. Wade and expanded the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. President Trump will continue to nominate highly qualified prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda."" "
the economy,"In a campaign speech Biden said, ""Look at what we've been able to get done: 14 million new jobs --- more jobs than any president has created in a four-year term; record economic growth --- over 5 percent just the last quarter; unemployment under 4 percent for 20 months in a row, another record; the lowest inflation rate of any major economy on Earth; and we have more work to do."" ","Trump's campaign website said, ""President Donald J. Trump passed record-setting tax relief for the middle class, doubled the child tax credit, and slashed more job-killing regulations than any administration had ever done before. Real wages quickly increased as a result, and median household income reached the highest level in the history of our country, while poverty reached a record low. President Trump created nearly 9,000 Opportunity Zones to revitalize neglected communities. President Trump produced a booming economic recovery, and record low unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and women. Joe Biden is the destroyer of America's jobs and continues to fuel runaway inflation with reckless big government spending. President Trump's vision for America's economic revival is lower taxes, bigger paychecks, and more jobs for American workers."" "
Social Security,,"Trumps campaign website said, ""Under no circumstances should Republicans vote to cut a single penny from Medicare or Social Security. Republicans shouldn't punish seniors to fund Biden's spending spree. Biden has blown out the federal budget and wasted trillions of dollars. While we must stop Biden's out-of-control spending, bureaucrats in Washington should feel the pain, not hard-working Americans."" "
taxes,"In a campaign speech Biden said, ""You know, does anyone here think the tax code is fair?  We have about a thousand billionaires in America now.  We had 750 billionaires before the pandemic.  You know what their tax rate is?  Eight percent.  E-I-G-H-T.  Eight percent of a billion-dollar income.  That's less than a firefighter or a teacher pay.  That's wrong. That's why I'm proposing a billionaire minimum tax.  To get this billionaire minimum tax at just 25 percent, you know how much additional revenue that would generate?  Four hundred and forty billion dollars over the next 10 years.  Just 25 percent.  That's a hell of a lot less than all of you pay.  Just 25 percent."" ","Trump's campaign website said, ""President Trump's vision for America's economic revival is lower taxes, bigger paychecks, and more jobs for American workers."" "
inflation,,"Trump's campaign website said, ""When I'm back in the White House, I will immediately unleash energy production, slash regulations, like I did just three years ago, and repeal Biden's tax hikes to get inflation down as fast as possible, and it will go quickly, so that interest rates can get back under control. I built the greatest economy in the history of the world."" "
job creation,"In a campaign speech Biden said, ""Look, and we're living through one of the greatest job-creation periods in history.  That's because we decided --- and some of you  have helped me a great deal, including the members of Congress, in investing in America. Invest in America."" ","Trump's campaign website said, ""Under my policies, we had virtually no inflation. We had tremendous job creation. We had rapid wage growth for the first time in many, many years. And we had more than 17,000 new factories open up for business right here in the USA. Through my Strategic National Manufacturing Initiative, we will do it again. We'll be bigger and better and stronger than we've ever been. And we did a great job two years ago. We'll do even better this time."" "
education,,"Trump's campaign website said, ""President Trump believes that we owe our children great schools that lead to great jobs, which will lead to an even greater country than we're living in right now. To that end, President Trump will work to ensure that a top priority of every school is to prepare students for jobs. In connection with totally refocusing schools on succeeding in the world of work, President Trump pledges to close the Department of Education in Washington, D.C. and to send all education work and needs back to the States."" "
charter schools and voucher programs,,"Trump's campaign website said ""President Trump supports universal school choice so that parents can send their children to the public, private, or religious school that best suits their needs, their goals, and their values."" "
school curriculums and parental involvement,,"Trump's campaign website said, ""President Trump supports the right of parents to know what their children are being taught in the classroom, to be able to openly communicate any of their concerns with teachers and principals, to protect the privacy of their children, to be made aware of changing academic standards, to be updated on any acts of violence occurring at school, to inspect professional development materials, to be notified before an out-of-school guest speaks in class or at a school event, to review the budget and spending of their children's school, to know if a school employee is working to address bullying or mental health concerns (including drug use or weapon use), to consent to all student surveys related to health, to have the right to opt out of school healthcare services, and to be immediately notified if a teacher or other school employee has worked to change their children's name, pronouns, or understanding of his or her gender."" "
college affordability,"In a campaign speech Biden said, ""Despite actions of the Supreme Court and MAGA Republicans, we've relieved student debt for 3.6 million Americans, who now have a chance to buy their first home and pay their debts and get out of debt."" ",
election policy,,"Trump's campaign website said, ""President Donald J. Trump is committed to the honesty of our elections and the integrity of our Republic. We will reform our election laws to verify the identity and eligibility of all voters to ensure faith and confidence in all future elections. We will pass a bold range of critical election integrity measures that include banning unsecure drop boxes and ballot harvesting. State and local officials cannot be permitted to make illegal and unconstitutional changes to election procedures without the required approvals by the state legislatures. Very importantly, we must ban private money from pouring into local election offices."" "
energy and environmental issues,,"Trump's campaign website said, ""Joe Biden reversed the Trump Energy Revolution and is now enriching foreign adversaries abroad. President Trump will unleash the production of domestic energy resources, reduce the soaring price of gasoline, diesel and natural gas, promote energy security for our friends around the world, eliminate the socialist Green New Deal and ensure the United States is never again at the mercy of a foreign supplier of energy."" "
climate change,"In a campaign speech Biden said, ""We passed the biggest investment in history to combat climate change, because I believe climate change is the only existential threat we have. I mean that in a literal sense. Not a joke. If we don't get it under control, we will have mortgaged not only the next generation, but mortgaged humanity. I believe that with every fiber of my being."" ","Trump's campaign website said ""President Trump will once again exit the horrendously unfair Paris Climate Accords and oppose all of the radical left's Green New Deal policies that are designed to shut down the development of America's abundant energy resources, which exceed any country's in the world, including Russia and Saudi Arabia. [...] President Trump will immediately stop all Joe Biden policies that distort energy markets, limit consumer choice, and drive-up costs on consumers, including insane wind subsidies, and DoE and EPA regulations that prevent Americans from buying incandescent lightbulbs, gas stoves, quality dishwashers and shower heads, and much more."" "
energy production,,"Trump's campaign website said, ""Under President Donald J. Trump's leadership, the United States became the number one producer of oil and natural gas on earth, achieving American energy independence and delivering historically low costs for oil, gas, diesel, and electricity to consumers and businesses. President Trump unlocked our country's God-given abundance of oil, natural gas, and clean coal. He approved the Keystone XL and Dakota Access, pipelines, opening federal lands and offshore areas for responsible oil and gas production."" "
"environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG)",,"Trump's campaign website said, ""The entire ESG scheme is designed to funnel your retirement money to the maniacs on the radical left. The rule we issued under my leadership was the first ESG ban anywhere in the world. And I'm delighted that Republicans in Congress and across the country have been waking up to this threat and following my lead."" "
federalism,,
foreign policy,"In an op-ed Biden wrote, ""The United States is the essential nation. We rally allies and partners to stand up to aggressors and make progress toward a brighter, more peaceful future. The world looks to us to solve the problems of our time. That is the duty of leadership, and America will lead. For if we walk away from the challenges of today, the risk of conflict could spread, and the costs to address them will only rise. We will not let that happen."" ","Trump's campaign website said, ""President Donald J. Trump replaced the failed policy of never-ending war, regime change and nation-building with a bold vision to pursue peace through strength. [...] Joe Biden has undermined our military readiness and surrendered our strength to the Taliban. President Trump will defend America against all threats, protect America against all dangers, and keep America out of unnecessary foreign wars. He will also get Biden's radical left ideology out of our military and rehire every patriot who was unjustly fired. To protect our people from the threat of nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles, President Trump will also build a state-of-the-art next-generation missile defense shield."" "
foreign policy towards China,,"Trump's campaign website said, ""As I have long said, Economic Security is NATIONAL security. [...] To protect our country, we need to enact aggressive new restrictions on Chinese ownership of any vital infrastructure in the United States, including energy, technology, telecommunications, farmland, natural resources, medical supplies, and other strategic national assets. We should stop all future Chinese purchases in these essential industries. And we should begin the process of forcing the Chinese to sell any current holdings that put our national security at risk."" "
foreign policy towards Russia,,"Trump's campaign website said, ""Our foreign policy establishment keeps trying to pull the world into conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia based on the lie that Russia represents our greatest threat. But the greatest threat to Western Civilization today is not Russia. It's probably, more than anything else, ourselves and some of the horrible, U.S.A. hating people that represent us."" "
the war in Ukraine,"In an op-ed Biden wrote, ""We know from two world wars in the past century that when aggression in Europe goes unanswered, the crisis does not burn itself out. It draws America in directly. That's why our commitment to Ukraine today is an investment in our own security. It prevents a broader conflict tomorrow. We are keeping American troops out of this war by supporting the brave Ukrainians defending their freedom and homeland. We are providing them with weapons and economic assistance to stop Putin's drive for conquest, before the conflict spreads farther."" ","Trump's campaign website said, ""Every day this proxy battle in Ukraine continues, we risk global war. We must be absolutely clear that our objective is to IMMEDIATELY have a total cessation of hostilities. All shooting has to stop. This is the central issue. We need PEACE without delay."" "
the Middle East and North Africa,,
South and Central America,,
the Israel-Palestine conflict,"In an op-ed Biden wrote, ""We stand firmly with the Israeli people as they defend themselves against the murderous nihilism of Hamas."" Biden continued, ""Our goal should not be simply to stop the war for today --- it should be to end the war forever, break the cycle of unceasing violence, and build something stronger in Gaza and across the Middle East so that history does not keep repeating itself. [...] This much is clear: A two-state solution is the only way to ensure the long-term security of both the Israeli and Palestinian people. Though right now it may seem like that future has never been further away, this crisis has made it more imperative than ever."" ",
government ethics,,"Trump's campaign website said, ""President Donald J. Trump is committed to dismantling the deep state and restoring government by the People, just as he did during his administration. President Trump will conduct a top-to-bottom overhaul of the federal bureaucracies to clean out the rot and corruption of Washington D.C. President Trump will push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on members of Congress, a permanent ban on taxpayer funding of campaigns, a lifetime ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and cabinet members, and a ban on members of Congress trading stocks with insider information."" "
gun regulation,"In an op-ed Biden wrote, ""I have already taken more meaningful executive action to reduce gun violence than any other president, and I will continue to pursue every legal and effective action. But my power is not absolute. Congress must act, including by banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, requiring gun owners to securely store their firearms, requiring background checks for all gun sales, and repealing gun manufacturers' immunity from liability. We also need more governors and state legislators to take these steps."" ","Trump's campaign website said, ""He will also always defend your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms."" "
healthcare,,"Trump's campaign website said, ""President Donald J. Trump empowered American patients by greatly expanding healthcare choice, transparency, and affordability. He increased competition in the health insurance market, eliminated the Obamacare individual mandate, and signed Right to Try that gives terminally ill patients access to lifesaving cures. President Trump lowered drug prices for the first time in over 50 years and finalized the Most Favored Nation Rule to ensure that pharmaceutical companies offer the same discounts to the United States as they do to other nations."" "
Medicare,"In a campaign speech Biden said, ""I've been fighting for decades taking on Big Pharma --- God, that was a nice win --- to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices.  And finally, Kamala and I got it done. Seniors on Medicare who were paying as much as 400 bucks a month for insulin are now paying $35 a month. And it only costs them 12 bucks to make it and package it, by the way. We're also capping total out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $2,000 a year, even if expensive cancer drugs are needed that cost $10-, $12-, $14,000 a year."" ","Trump's campaign website said, ""Under no circumstances should Republicans vote to cut a single penny from Medicare or Social Security. Republicans shouldn't punish seniors to fund Biden's spending spree. Biden has blown out the federal budget and wasted trillions of dollars. While we must stop Biden's out-of-control spending, bureaucrats in Washington should feel the pain, not hard-working Americans."" "
sex and gender issues,,"Trump's campaign website said, ""I will ask Congress to pass a bill establishing that the only genders recognized by the United States government are male and female---and they are assigned at birth. The bill will also make clear that Title Nine prohibits men from participating in women's sports. And we will protect the rights of parents from being forced to allow their minor child to assume a gender, which is new, and an identity without the parents' consent. The identity will not be new. And it will not be without parental consent."" "
transgender healthcare,,"Trump's campaign website said, ""I will sign a new executive order instructing every federal agency to cease all programs that promote the concept of sex and gender transition at any age. I will then ask Congress to permanently stop federal taxpayer dollars from being used to promote or pay for these procedures, and pass a law prohibiting child sexual mutilation in all 50 states. It'll go very quickly. I will declare that any hospital or healthcare provider that participates in the chemical or physical mutilation of minor youth will no longer meet federal health and safety standards for Medicaid and Medicare---and will be terminated from the program immediately."" "
immigration,,"Trump's campaign website said, ""President Trump will shut down Biden's border disaster. He will again end catch-and-release, restore Remain in Mexico, and eliminate asylum fraud. In cooperative states, President Trump will deputize the National Guard and local law enforcement to assist with rapidly removing illegal alien gang members and criminals. He will also deliver a merit-based immigration system that protects American labor and promotes American values."" "
border security,,"Trump's campaign website said, ""President Donald J. Trump created the most secure border in U.S. history. He ended catch-and-release, took down human traffickers, deported record numbers of illegal alien gang members, and built 450 miles of powerful new wall."" "
immigration enforcement,,"Trump's campaign website said, ""Joe Biden turned our country into one giant sanctuary for dangerous criminal aliens when he suspended all immigration enforcement in the middle of a global pandemic and reversed landmark agreements that safely returned asylum-seekers to Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. The onslaught of illegal aliens invading our wide-open borders threatens public safety, drains the treasury, undermines U.S. workers, and burdens schools and hospitals. President Trump will shut down Biden's border disaster. He will again end catch-and-release, restore Remain in Mexico, and eliminate asylum fraud. In cooperative states, President Trump will deputize the National Guard and local law enforcement to assist with rapidly removing illegal alien gang members and criminals. He will also deliver a merit-based immigration system that protects American labor and promotes American values."" "
infrastructure,"In a campaign speech Biden said, ""We passed [...] the biggest investment of rebuilding America's infrastructure since his President Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System.  And, you know, roads, bridges, clean water, high-speed Internet, all --- and cheap for people, available to people."" ","Trump's campaign website said, ""In other words, we'll actually build new cities in our country again. These Freedom Cities will reopen the frontier, reignite American imagination, and give hundreds of thousands of young people and other people, all hardworking families, a new shot at home ownership and in fact, the American Dream. [...] I will challenge the governors of all 50 states to join me in a great modernization and beautification campaign---getting rid of ugly buildings, refurbishing our parks and our public spaces, making cities and towns more livable, ensuring a pristine environment, and building towering monuments to our true American heroes."" "
opioids and drug issues,,"Trump's campaign website said, ""President Donald J. Trump marshalled the full power of government to stop deadly drugs, opioids, and fentanyl from coming into our country. As a result, drug overdose deaths declined nationwide for the first time in nearly 30 years. Joe Biden has allowed drug cartels to wage war on America, steal innocent lives, and ravage our communities. President Trump will take down the drug cartels just as he took down ISIS."" "
trade,,"Trump's campaign website said, ""The heart of my vision is a sweeping pro-American overhaul of our tax and trade policy to move from the Biden system that punishes domestic producers and rewards outsourcers, to a system that REWARDS domestic production and taxes FOREIGN companies and those who export American Jobs. They will be rewarded and rewarded greatly. And our country will benefit. To achieve this goal, we will phase in a system of universal, baseline tariffs on most foreign products. On top of this, higher tariffs will increase incrementally depending on how much individual foreign countries devalue their currency."" "
trade with China,,"Trump's campaign website said, ""President Trump will implement a 4-year national reshoring plan so that the United States no longer needs to rely on China for essential medical and national security goods, and ban Chinese ownership of all critical infrastructure in the United States. We will bring back our supply chains, and build America into the manufacturing superpower of the world."" "
veterans,,"Trump's campaign website said, ""President Donald J. Trump passed the largest reform of the Department of Veterans Affairs in a generation, including VA Accountability and VA Choice, and fired 11,500 federal workers who failed to give our wounded warriors the quality and timely care they so richly deserve. He secured record funding for mental health services, and expanded access to telehealth and suicide prevention resources. To secure the blessings of freedom for those who risked their lives to defend it, President Trump decreased veteran homelessness, increased educational benefits, and achieved record-low veteran unemployment.""
