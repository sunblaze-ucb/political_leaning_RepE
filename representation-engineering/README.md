## Installation

To install `repe` from the github repository main branch, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andyzoujm/representation-engineering.git
cd representation-engineering
pip install -e .
```
## Quickstart

Our RepReading and RepControl pipelines inherit the [ðŸ¤— Hugging Face pipelines](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines) for both classification and generation.

```python
from repe import repe_pipeline_registry # register 'rep-reading' and 'rep-control' tasks into Hugging Face pipelines
repe_pipeline_registry()

# ... initializing model and tokenizer ....

rep_reading_pipeline =  pipeline("rep-reading", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
rep_control_pipeline =  pipeline("rep-control", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, **control_kwargs)
```

## RepReading and RepControl Experiments
Check out [example frontiers](./examples) of Representation Engineering (RepE), containing both RepControl and RepReading implementation. We welcome community contributions as well!

## RepE_eval
We also release a language model evaluation framework [RepE_eval](./repe_eval) based on RepReading that can serve as an additional baseline beside zero-shot and few-shot on standard benchmarks. Please check out our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01405) for more details.
